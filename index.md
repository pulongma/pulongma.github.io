About Me
======
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2em;"> 
 
I am Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/science/departments/math-stat/index.html" target="blank" style="color:blue;">School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.clemson.edu" target="blank" syle="color:blue;">Clemson University</a> since Fall 2021. Before joining Clemson, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) and Duke University from 2018-2021 mentored by <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~berger/" target="blank" style="color:blue;">Prof. Jim Berger</a> and <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~lm186/index.html" target="blank" style="color:blue;">Prof. Li Ma</a>, where I participated in the 2018-2019 research program on Model Uncertainty: Mathematical and Statistical (MUMS).  In 2018, I received my Ph.D. in statistics from University of Cincinnati under the guidance of <a href="https://emilystat.wixsite.com/gdads/" target="blank" style="color:blue;">Prof. Emily Kang</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lqnGbNkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="blank" style="color:blue;">Prof. Bledar Konomi</a> with my dissertation topic in Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Statistics.
